Given 2 arrays, create a function that let's a user
know (true/false) whether these two arrays contain any common items

Example
arr1 = ['a','b','c','x'];
arr2 = ['z','y','i'];
return false

arr1 = ['a','b','c','x'];
arr2 = ['z','y','i'];
return true;

Input (char array)
Output bool

Bruteforce method would be to nest loops, where we loop over a and check all values in arr2 if any match
Gives us a timecomplexity of O(n*m)

My solution loops over arr2, putting it into a Dictionary, which gives a time complexity of O(m)
Which is then used again to check arr1 towards that Dictionary, giving us a timecomplexity of O(n+m) = O(n)

I belive it is not necessary to use a Dictionary, since we do not use the int value for anything. That is why we can use a HashSet instead.
Which gives the same functionality, but less memory usage
